** kaldi nnet1 lstm, eg 20
+ batch_lstm T_{bptt} 
prepare one data batch stream, then train the nnet, and go on another, different from nnet training, which prepare all data done then train

if the length of the subsequence of an uttrance shorter than T_{bptt}, kaldi nnet1 fill it with the last frame of the uttrance

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
// for streams with new utterance, history states need to be reset
//new_utt_flags the flags of all streams
