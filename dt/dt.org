* dt 
ml优点易于训练，告诉你这是桌子。
dt在训练时不仅优化参数，而且对其竞争进行惩罚, 告诉你这是桌子而不是椅子。

** mmi
+ min the entropy of h(w|o), 即减少标注的不确定度
+ 其中p(w,o)=p(w|o)p(o), p(w|o)=1,p(o)为const

** mmi solution
+ gradient descent
+ extend em
由公式可以看出，求解该问题需要分别求解分子和分母，其中分子为标注，分母可以通过解码lattice生成的W来近似。


** mmi weakness 
+ computationally expensive to maximize objective function
+ Poor generalization to unseen data

** improving mmi generalization
+ scale language model
+ use weaked language model, eg trigram in train, bigram or unigram in dt(to generate more competive W)
即减少语言模型权重或者选择低阶的语言模型

** A COMPARISON OF TWO OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES FOR SEQUENCE DISCRIMINATIVE TRAINING OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS
author: George Saon and Hagen Soltau (IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598, USA)

SGD running
on a single GPU machine achieves the best accuracy 2.5 times
faster than DHF running on multiple non-GPU machines; however,
DHF training achieves a higher accuracy at the end of the optimization.
In addition, we present an improved modified forwardbackward
algorithm for computing lattice-based expected loss functions
and gradients that results in a 34% speedup for SGD.
